			<h3>A semi-brief history of my education and the stuff surrounding it</h3>

				<div>
					<p>I grew up in Los Angeles, CA. I went to schools in Brentwood and the Pacific Palisades (go Dolphins!) After high school I went to Santa Monica Collge for three years, then transferred to the University of California, Irvine where I earned my BA in Psychology and Social Behavior. I should have gone to a different school, like UC Santa Barbara or Santa Cruz. I had a pretty boring time in college.</p>

					<p>After college graduation I tried to get a job in the psychology field. There was always someone a little more qualified though, and the salaries were not competitive. Eventually I fell back into some familiar territory: retail work and childcare. I worked briefly as a sales associate at the Gap on the Santa Monica Promenade (LA's Pearl Street Mall) until I found a consistent nanny job. During that time I decided to go back to school and get a graduate degree, hoping that that would help me get a job. So I went to Pacific Oaks College in Pasadena, and for two years I studied Marriage and Family Therapy. While I was in grad school I was a nanny for a wonderful family in Santa Monica, and every day I would wake up in West LA, drive to Pasadena in LA traffic for 9am class, then drive to Santa Monica (back on the west-side) in time to pick up the girls from school by 3. My car accumulated a lot of miles in two years.</p>

					<p>Grad school turned out to be pretty stressful though, and after several solid months that included lots of learning about how underpaid and essentially useless we would all be after graduation, despite finding jobs, I decided to drop out of my program. I didn't know what I was going to do instead though, so I got a full-time job as a nanny for a 2-month old baby girl. I looked after Eden 10 hours a day, 5-6 days a week for a full year. Eventually though her mother decided she missed her baby too much, and was sad to be missing all of her milestones, so she left her job and I had to decide once again what I was going to do. It was then that my boyfriend and I decided there was no time like the present to pack up, leave California, and get our butts to the little mountain town we'd loved so much since we visited earlier that year. We spent the next few months making arrangements, and at the end of February we packed up the car and drove through California, Arizona, and New Mexico, and then up into Colorado to Boulder.</p>
